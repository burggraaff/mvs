This is a module with Python code I wrote while working on my MSc research project _Variable stars in MASCARA_.

This is extremely incomplete and work-in-progress!

To do:

- Remove astropy table dependency: use only numpy arrays internally
- Add example scripts
- Speed up GLS, chi^2 (port to C? Numpy magic?) or just scrap them and use better versions by others
